# this file contain infromation about python packages, packages that I have used over time and their explanations

# installation of packages are done using pip. pip use the Python Package Index (PyPi) -> https://pypi.org/

# example:
# Console: (do this from the /env directory)
# console: pip install python-dateutil

# console: pip freeze # - Prints a list of installed packages in the terminal (can be run inside the virtual environment to see what it has installed
                # but also OUTSIDE of the virtual environment to see what libraries is installed on the computer)



# other ways of installing packages
    # have a set of files on your machine and install from that source (local install)
    # console: cd <to where the package is on your machine>
    # console: python3 -m pip install. 

    # install from a GitHub repository that provides version control:
    # console: git+https://github.com/your-repo.git
    
    # install from a compressed archive file:
    # python3 -m pip install package.tar.gz
