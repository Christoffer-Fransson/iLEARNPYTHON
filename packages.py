# this file contain infromation about python packages, packages that I have used over time and their explanations

# installation of packages are done using pip. pip use the Python Package Index (PyPi) -> https://pypi.org/

# example:
# Console: (do this from the /env directory)
pip install python-dateutil

pip freeze # - Prints a list of installed packages in the terminal (can be run inside the virtual environment to see what it has installed
                # but also OUTSIDE of the virtual environment to see what libraries is installed on the computer)
