# THIS FILE CONTAIN OPERATORS IN PY

# Operators are used by a <left side> <operator> <right side>
# There are two major types of operators: arithmetic and assignment

left_side = 10
right_side = 5
left_side / right_side # 2
print (left_side / right_side) # Example using the variables in a operator context and printing the result

# --- Arithmetic operators ---
# Type    Description - example
#   +     Addition operator that adds two values together (1 +1) 
#   -     Subtraction operator that removes the value of the right side from the left side (1 - 2)
#   /     Division operator that divides the left side as many times as the right side specifices (10 / 2) 
#   *     Multiplication operator (2 * 2)

# --- Assignment operators ---
# Type      Example - Explanation
#   =       x = 2 (X now equals 2)
#   +=      x += 2 (x incremented by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 4)
#   -=      X -= 2 (x decremented by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 0)
#   /=      x /= 2 (x divided by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 1)
#   *=      x *= 2 (x multiplied by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 4)
